> analyze @"Task (1).pdf" and according to this remove extra things from the @sensor-dashboard-guide.md 
  as I have limited time, I don't want to waste extra time on the irrelevant things that are not required for the 
  proof of concept.
  ⎿  Read Task (1).pdf (84.9KB)

        95 +  **Focus:** Get a working proof-of-concept quickly. Avoid over-engineering.
        96   \ No newline at end of file

● Done! I've streamlined the guide from 8 hours to 6 hours by removing:

  Removed complexities:
  - Detailed documentation requirements (AI conversation logs, decision documents)
  - Extensive performance testing (JMeter, K6, detailed metrics)
  - Advanced features (Redis, 24-hour retention, complex memory management)
  - Over-engineered folder structure
  - Detailed evaluation criteria and submission checklists

  Kept essentials:
  - Core real-time streaming functionality
  - Basic anomaly detection
  - Simple charts and statistics
  - SignalR implementation
  - React frontend
  - Quick start commands

  The guide now focuses on getting a working proof-of-concept quickly without unnecessary documentation overhead.

> now following the rules of technical project management, follow the document @sensor-dashboard-guide.md 
  make me a step by step task list as tasks.md file
  plan frontend and backend task independently in such a way that non linked parts will be completed first, then we 
  will move to the tasks that should be completed side by side.
  divide it in proper sections 1, 1.3, 1.4.2 etc upto the heirarchy of your choice
  start each task with [ ] like this so I could mark it as [x] when completed.
  ```
  analyze it thoroughly, no requirement should be missed.
  I will be using React for frontend instead of angular and for streaming I will be using signalR as my choice, now 
  plan accordingly

     # Real-Time Sensor Analytics Dashboard - Task List
     ## 1. Backend Development (.NET Core API) - Independent Tasks
     ### 1.1 Project Setup & Configuration
     - [ ] 1.1.1 Create new .NET Core Web API project named "SensorAPI"
     - [ ] 1.1.2 Install Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR NuGet package
     - [ ] 1.1.3 Configure CORS policy for frontend communication
     - [ ] 1.1.4 Set up project folder structure (Controllers, Services, Models, Hubs)

● I've created a comprehensive tasks.md file with a hierarchical structure following technical project management
  principles. The task list is organized into 5 main sections with proper numbering (1.1.1, 1.2.3, etc.) and
  includes all requirements from the guide.

  Key Features:
  - Independent tasks first: Sections 1 & 2 can be completed in parallel without dependencies
  - Integration tasks: Section 3 requires both backend and frontend to be ready
  - React + SignalR focus: All tasks specifically planned for your technology choices
  - Checkbox format: Each task starts with [ ] for easy progress tracking
  - 3-phase execution strategy: Clear phases for parallel work, integration, and testing
  - Time estimates: 6-hour total timeline matching your streamlined requirements

  The structure ensures maximum efficiency by allowing frontend and backend development to proceed independently
  before integration begins.

> for our case, we will be taking "smart building system" as project.
  Use Case: Building environment and energy monitoring

  Sensors: Temperature, humidity, CO2, occupancy, power consumption

  Alerts: HVAC failures, abnormal energy usage, air quality issues

  Project Name: smartBuildingSolution

● I've updated the tasks.md file to reflect the Smart Building System context. The key changes include:

  Updated Elements:
  - Project name: Changed to "SmartBuildingAPI" instead of generic "SensorAPI"
  - Sensor types: Specified Temperature, Humidity, CO2, Occupancy, PowerConsumption
  - Realistic ranges: Added specific ranges for building sensors (18-26°C, 30-70% humidity, 400-1000ppm CO2, etc.)
  - Alert types: Added HVACFailure, AbnormalEnergyUsage, AirQualityIssue, OccupancyAnomaly
  - Anomaly detection: Focused on HVAC failures, abnormal energy usage, and air quality issues
  - Dashboard naming: Updated to "SmartBuilding Dashboard"

  The task structure and hierarchy remain the same since they were already well-organized for technical project
  management. All requirements from your smart building use case are now properly integrated into the existing
  framework.
