# Smart Building Real-Time Sensor Analytics Platform

A real-time sensor monitoring and analytics dashboard built with React (frontend) and .NET Core (backend), featuring live data streaming via SignalR, anomaly detection, and interactive visualizations.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Streaming**: Live sensor data updates via SignalR WebSockets with automatic reconnection
- **Multiple Sensor Types**: Temperature, Humidity, CO2, Occupancy, and Power Consumption monitoring
- **Anomaly Detection**: Automatic threshold-based anomaly detection with severity categorization
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Modern, responsive UI with real-time charts and statistics
- **High Performance**: Handles 1000+ readings/second with zero-heap allocations
- **Alert Management**: Real-time anomaly alerts with categorized severity levels
- **Subscription Model**: Selective sensor monitoring to optimize bandwidth
- **Data Aggregation**: Real-time statistics with incremental updates

## Installation & Setup

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd sensor-data-streaming-platform
```

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend/SmartBuildingAPI
```

2. Restore dependencies:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

3. Run the backend:

```bash
dotnet run
```

The backend will start on http://localhost:5135

- Swagger UI: http://localhost:5135/swagger
- SignalR Hub: http://localhost:5135/sensorHub

### Frontend Setup

1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will start on http://localhost:5173

## Usage

1. **Start Both Services**: Ensure both backend (port 5135) and frontend (port 5173) are running

2. **Open the Dashboard**: Navigate to http://localhost:5173 in your browser

3. **Select Sensors**: Click on sensor cards to enable/disable monitoring for specific sensor types

4. **Monitor Data**:

   - View real-time charts updating with live sensor data
   - Monitor statistics cards showing current, min, max, and average values
   - Observe anomaly alerts in the alerts panel

5. **Interact with Features**:
   - Toggle sensor monitoring on/off
   - View historical data in charts
   - Clear alerts when reviewed
   - Monitor connection status

## Architecture

### Data Flow

1. Backend generates simulated sensor data at configurable rates (100-1000/sec)
2. Data is processed for anomaly detection and statistics calculation
3. SignalR broadcasts updates to connected clients via WebSocket/SSE
4. Frontend receives and visualizes data in real-time
5. Charts and statistics update dynamically without page refresh

### Technical Architecture

#### Backend Architecture

- **Data Storage**: Lock-free circular buffer with 100,000 data points capacity
- **Processing**: Batch processing every 100ms for optimal throughput
- **Communication**: Hub-based SignalR with WebSocket primary, SSE fallback
- **Optimization**: Zero-heap allocations per reading through efficient memory management
- **Statistics**: Incremental updates with caching for performance

#### Frontend Architecture

- **State Management**: Singleton SignalR service with EventEmitter pattern
- **Data Windowing**: Last 100 seconds displayed for optimal performance
- **Rendering**: Throttled chart updates at 10 FPS
- **Optimization**: React.memo and useCallback for component efficiency
- **Connection**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff

### Key Components

#### Backend Services

- **SensorDataGenerator**: Generates realistic sensor readings with configurable rates
- **AnomalyDetectionService**: Threshold-based anomaly detection with severity levels
- **StatisticsService**: Incremental statistics calculation with caching
- **SignalR Hub**: WebSocket connection management with subscription model
- **Data Management**: Lock-free circular buffer with automatic cleanup

#### Frontend Components

- **Dashboard**: Main container with optimized re-rendering
- **RealtimeChart**: Chart.js visualization with 10 FPS throttling
- **StatisticsCard**: Real-time metrics display (current, min, max, avg)
- **AlertPanel**: Categorized anomaly alerts with clear functionality
- **SensorSelector**: Toggle-based sensor subscription management
- **SignalR Service**: Singleton connection manager with event emitter

## API Endpoints

### REST API

- `GET /api/sensor/readings/recent` - Get recent sensor readings
- `GET /api/sensor/statistics` - Get current statistics
- `GET /api/sensor/alerts/recent` - Get recent alerts
- `POST /api/sensor/generation/rate` - Adjust generation rate

### SignalR Events

#### Client Events (Receive)

- `ReceiveSensorReading` - New sensor data batch (10-50 readings)
- `ReceiveStatisticsUpdate` - Aggregated statistics updates
- `ReceiveAnomalyAlert` - Anomaly notifications with severity

#### Server Methods (Send)

- `SubscribeToSensor` - Subscribe to specific sensor type
- `UnsubscribeFromSensor` - Unsubscribe from sensor type
- Connection management with automatic reconnection

## Performance

### Capabilities

- **Throughput**: 100-1000 readings per second
- **Latency**: Minimal latency with batch processing every 100ms
- **Data Capacity**: 100,000 data points in-memory circular buffer
- **Chart Performance**: Throttled to 10 FPS with last 100 seconds windowing
- **Network Optimization**: Message compression for WebSocket frames
- **Memory Management**: Zero-heap allocations per reading

### Optimizations

- Lock-free data structures using Interlocked operations
- Batched updates (10-50 readings) for network efficiency
- Removed point markers for dense data visualization (100+ points)
- Efficient data transformation layer in frontend
